        <h2>Project Information Background</h2>
        <p>The project "Teaching New Tricks to Academic Staff" is a collaborative initiative aimed at providing essential insights and best practices for academic staff at the University of Bristol (UoB). The project focuses on addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the delivery of teaching for coding and data science courses.</p>

    <div id="Purpose" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The main purpose of this project is to compile and develop a comprehensive set of strategies and best practices to support academic staff in effectively delivering coding and data science courses in COVID-19 settings. One of the innovative strategies proposed is Gamified Pair Programming (GPP), aimed at enhancing student engagement and collaborative learning experiences.</p>

    <div id="Objectives" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>There are 2 objectives set for this project:</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 1</strong>: To discover and test a new method, which is game-based pair programming, for teaching coding and data science during the Covid-19 phase using existing research.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 2</strong>: To develop a short training plan for staff to be deployed and tested during the final phase to validate the selected trick.</p>
