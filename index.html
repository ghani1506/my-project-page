        <h2>Project Information Background</h2>
        <p>This project explores <strong>best tricks or approaches in teaching scientific computing with data science during the phase of Covid-19 pandemic. Such situation required an abrupt transition to online education, giving significant challenges for both educators and learners. The inquiry searches to identify the most effective strategies employed by educators in navigating this new norm, particularly within the field of teaching coding and data science within the School of Chemistry. To achieve our objectives, we intend to conduct comprehensive literature reviews and administer surveys to educators to discover their experiences and preferences. Through thorough data analysis, utilizing appropriate statistical methodologies, we aim to obtain evidence-based insights into effective training practices. Provided with this knowledge, we will develop a designed training program for educators, which will undergo thorough testing and validation to ensure its effectiveness. 
</strong>, focusing on <strong>[key aspects or goals]</strong>. The work includes detailed experimental procedures, data analysis, and theoretical insights that contribute to the field of chemistry.</p>
