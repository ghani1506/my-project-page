        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>There are 2 objectives set for this project:</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 1</strong> : To discover and test a new method, which is game-based pair programming, for teaching coding and data science during the Covid-19 phase using existing research.
</p>
        <p><strong>Objective 2</strong> : To develop short training plan for staff to be deployed and tested during the final phase to validate the selected approach.
